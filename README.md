# Stock Price Trend Prediction

For this project, we trained both the Naive Bayes model (the generative probabilistic model) and the LSTM model (the discriminative neural network) to perform sentiment analysis to predict stock market movement using the daily news headlines dataset. These two approaches are applied to both the real-world data and the synthetic data generated from the Naive Bayes model. In conclusion, in both “real” data and synthetic data cases, our Naive Bayes model performs better than the LSTM model in terms of higher model accuracy and lower model complexity in terms of time and space.
